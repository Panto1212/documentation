    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a
    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide
    programmatic control over them.
</p>
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object
    Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
    user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>  
    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For
    example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
    from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
</ul>
