<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language.
    Inside a
    host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to
    provide
    programmatic control over them.
</p>
<p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language
    elements
    such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of
    purposes by
    supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document
        Object
        Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
        respond to
        user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
    <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a
        server. For
        example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of
        information
        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
</ul>

<p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
    <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
    <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main
        page about
        JavaScript.

    <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
    <article>
<p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language
    resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java
    expression
    syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from
    LiveScript to
    JavaScript.</p>
<p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system
    based
    on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a
    prototype-based
    object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
    inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions
    without any
    special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
<p>JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and
    methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not
    have to
    implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>

    <header>Variables</header>
    <article>
<p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers,
    conform
    to certain rules.</p>
<p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can
    also be
    digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase)
    and the
    characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
<p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape
    sequences
    as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

    <header>Global Variables</header>
    <article>
<p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you
    can set
    and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
<p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by
    specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document,
    you can
    refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>

<div class="main-section " id="data-types">
    <header>Data Types</header>
    <article>
<p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Six data types that are primitives:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the
            same as Null,
            NULL, or any other variant.</li>
        <li>undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.</li>
        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Object</li>
</ol>
<p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your
    applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
    objects as
    named containers for values, and functions as procedures that your application can perform.
